# Internet-Speed-Test-using-Python

> When checking the speed of the Internet connection, the results are displayed as download speed and upload speed. Download speed refers to the speed at which your internet connection downloads data from the internet and upload speed refers to the speed at which your internet connection uploads data to the internet. So, calculating the download speed and the upload speed of an Internet connection sums up the Internet speed test.

> To calculate the speed of your internet connection using Python, you have to install a Python library known as speedtest. If you have never used it before then you can easily install it on your system by using the pip command:

> pip install speedtest-cli
